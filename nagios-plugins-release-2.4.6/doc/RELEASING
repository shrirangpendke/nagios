The Nagios Plugins Release Process

This document describes the process to release a new version of Nagios Plugins.
 
*** Pre-Release:

Verify that the release branch is not behind master on any commits.  If it is, merge master into release branch first.
Then merge the release branch into master and push to origin.
Checkout master, pull, and then build one more time. Check compilation, make all, and make test.
  
  $ . tools/devmode (if you are feeling adventurous.) 
  $ ./configure
  $ make all
  $ make test


*** Verify Attribution Files:

Make sure all contributors since last release have been added to THANKS.in.
Update AUTHORS if there are new project members.


*** Prepare and Commit Release Files:

Update NEWS file - adhere to the format found in earlier entries.
Update configure.ac and NP-VERSION-GEN with version:
NP-VERSION-GEN:

  DEF_VER=x.x.x.git

configure.ac:

  AC_INIT(nagios-plugins,x.x.x)

Commit NEWS, configure.ac, and NP-VERSION-GEN - use the commit message "Prep for x.x.x"


*** Create a New Annotated Tag:
